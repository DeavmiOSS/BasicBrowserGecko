## Gecko (IE8 alternative)
Now with [GeckoFX](https://code.google.com/p/geckofx/). As a result, please extract the `XULRunner misc files.rar` archive to the `Debug` (or `Release` if you are compiling to there) folder before running BasicBrowser (you can compile it without problems though). The main DLLs of XULRunner are copied automatically by compiling.

As of November 2014, this repo has the Gecko branch, it was previously in [Walkman100/BasicBrowser](https://github.com/Walkman100/BasicBrowser). The hybrid branch has also been transferred here, since it is essentially BasicBrowserGecko with the ability to open IE tabs as well.

## Compile requirements
See [CompileInstructions.md](https://github.com/Walkman100/WinCompile/blob/master/CompileInstructions.md)
